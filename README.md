## Upgrade the VPN wallet to v3.4.0

Modified from [JeffreyDC](https://github.com/JeffreyDC/Metrix/blob/master/install.sh).

**This script is for only upgrading the wallet and it comes with no warranty!**
All should be fine if you follow the instructions, otherwise contact the team for support (Use the channel [#support-main](https://discord.gg/FJ2CqD)).

Enter the follow at the shell prompt...

```
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:ckhatton/metrix-repo.git
sudo sh metrix-repo/metrix_upgrade_3.4.0.sh
```

All being well, that should upgrade the wallet and fire it up again without any interruptions ðŸ˜Œ

### If you are running a hot/cold masternode setup

Unlock the wallet if locked with a passphrase. Then type `metrix-cli masternode start`. It should report that the masternode has been started remotely.

> **Note:**
>
> If it reports the masternode cannot be started, it is likely the database needs rebuilding.
> 
> Run the command `metrix-cli stop` and then the command `metrixd` to start up the wallet again.
>
> If it does say the database needs to be rebuilt, and you wish to do so, type "yes" follow by hitting return (Enter). It should take around 4 hours to complete.
