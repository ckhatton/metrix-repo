## Upgrade the VPN wallet to v3.4.0

Modified from [JeffreyDC](https://github.com/JeffreyDC/Metrix/blob/master/install.sh).

**This script is for only upgrading the wallet and it comes with no warranty!**
All should be fine if you follow the instructions, otherwise contact the team for support.

Enter the follow at the shell prompt...

```
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:ckhatton/metrix-repo.git
sudo sh metrix-repo/metrix_upgrade_3.4.0.sh
```

All being well, that should upgrade the wallet and fire it up again without any interruptions ðŸ˜Œ

> If it says the database needs to be rebuilt for whatever reason, and you wish to do so, type "yes" follow by getting return (Enter). It should take around 4 hours to complete.
